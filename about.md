People get upset in the face of unknowns. To me, the feelings of losing control are like drugs that exert the passion and desire, from my nature, to conquer and challenge new territories...

#### A Learner
As a student in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu) (EECS) department at UC Berkeley, I, like every one of my fellow classmates does, routinely shuttle among bedroom, classrooms and labs. Three years on this campus I've been seeking for one question: what does it mean to be a Berkeley Engineer.

Resuming my acdemic persuit as a third-year student, I found my passion in the applications of Machine Learning techniques in Computer Security and Embedded Systems. Currently I'm doing research at [Berkeley Wireless Research Center](https://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/user/yanming-chen), [Terraswarm Lab](http://www.terraswarm.org) and [Berkeley Security Research Lab](http://security.cs.berkeley.edu).

#### An Explorer
Travelling is my liberator from boring repentance of everyday life. New places stimulate my curiosity, and a great feeling of accomplishment, in turn, arises from my explorations.
